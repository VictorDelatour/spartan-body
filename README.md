# spartan-body

Spartan-body is an n-body solver that uses the [MADNESS](https://github.com/m-a-d-n-e-s-s/madness/) numerical environment and was written as part of an internship. The goal of said internship was to test the feasibility of an n-body solver based on MADNESS and compare its accuracy and performance with a particle-mesh method based n-body solver using the Fastest Fourier Transform in the West library.

The name was coined as a joke from the movie "300" - "Madness? This is sparta" - as a combination between sparta and n-body. The reference code, using FFT, is called Xerxes, the persian King responsible for the battle of Thermopylae that gave rise to the legend of the 300 spartans that fought under King Leonidas.
